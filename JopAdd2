Her eyes darted around side to side at first. Then she slowly turned all the way around. She kept walking and she felt her heart 
expand for a moment as she smiled to herself. She had another secret. This one reminded her of when she was little and would find 
little bits of color and keep them in her pocket. Small pieces of colored paper, little bits of string, a purple stone. Those things
were long gone now. "Focus", she reminded herself. She felt her face get more serious. As she kept walking, she noticed the 
forest was starting to thin. She wondered why it was. There were many reasons she could think of all swirlling in her mind. At last 
she thought, I have made it. As she edged to the clearing she saw a giant cliff. Or should she call it a mountain? She was not sure
what to do. She was fairly certian she was in the rebels camp. But she was not sure where to go next. She had only heard echos and 
whispers of this place. Such as "old cave","used to be a monument","the old humans loved it",","Black Hills." There was uncertianity
with what she would find, if anything. All Anya knew for certian was this was her last chance for a life of any kind. She couldn't 
live in the New Society. She shuddered just thinking about her old life.
